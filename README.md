This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript 3 related to collision detection using the getBounds() method.  The `bug.as` file showcases the flawed collision detection logic, and `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected implementation.  The issue arises when DisplayObjects haven't been added to the display list; their bounds are incorrectly reported as empty, leading to false negatives in collision detection.

This example highlights the importance of verifying that DisplayObjects are correctly added to the display list before performing calculations using methods like getBounds().
